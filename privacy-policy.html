                <h3>Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>

                <h4>Law enforcement</h4>
                <p>Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose Your Personal Data if required
                    to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a court or a government
                    agency).</p>

                <h3>Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
                <p>The security of Your Personal Data is important to Us, but remember that no method of transmission
                    over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While We strive to use
                    commercially reasonable means to protect Your Personal Data, We cannot guarantee its absolute
                    security.</p>
               
                <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country
                    requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that
                    information.</p>
